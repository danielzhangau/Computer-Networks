# Computer Networks
UQ COMS

OSI & Internet reference models. Communication protocols for Local, Metropolitan & Wide Area Networks. BISDN networks. The Internet protocol suite. Mobile Networks. Quality of service in communication protocols. Network security. Trends in communication networks.
The course is based around the Internet protocol stack and works through the layer of the protocols.
Firstly, fundamental principles and metrics for computer networking are described, and the overall architecture of the Internet is described.
The application layer looks at protocols such as HTTP, DNS, SMTP.
The transport layer looks at UDP and TCP.
The network layer looks at IPv4, IPv6, and routing algorithms and protocols.
The Link Layer looks at Ethernet, Link layer Addressing, and ARP.
The physical layer is not considered in detail.
